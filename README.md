## Instructions
- __Set up SQL Server (or other db):__ built with SQL Server in mind, but probably can use any db that's supported by SQL Alchemy
- __Configure connection.json:__ Use connection.example.json as an example and create connection.json in the base directory
- __Execute Main:__ Maybe someday this will be an actual library, but not today
- __Use Generic Query to Explore Data:__ Optionally, use the GenericQuery as a basis for querying the resulting database
